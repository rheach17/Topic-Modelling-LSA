# Topic-Modelling-LSA
<br>
 At the document level, one of the most useful ways to understand text is by analyzing its topics. 
The process of learning, recognizing, and extracting these topics across a collection of documents is called topic modeling.
<br>
The core idea is -
<ul><li>take a matrix of what we have â€” documents and terms (document - term matrix)</li>
  <li>decompose it into a separate document-topic matrix and a topic-term matrix.</li></ul>
